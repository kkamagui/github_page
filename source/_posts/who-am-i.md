I'm Seunghun Han (a.k.a kkamagui) at National Security Research Institute of South Korea. I was an eMMC firmware developer at Samsung. Currently, I'm a senior security researcher, a hypervisor developer, and an operating system developer.  

I'm also a member of the Influencer Program at Black Hat Asia and can distribute discount code for the Black Hat Asia. If you are going to the conference, feel free to contact me via [Twitter: @kkamagui1](https://twitter.com/kkamagui1), [Facebook: Seunghun Han](https://www.facebook.com/seunghoon.han.3701), and [LinkedIn: Seunghun Han](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seunghun-han-717bb5b0/).

I have been doing various kinds of research from security analysis to hypervisor and OS development. I published two books and several papers about them. They are listed below.

## [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)](#cve)
I found security vulnerabilities in many kinds of software such as the Linux kernel, Trusted Boot (tBoot) and TPM2.0-TSS.
 - [CVE-2017-11472](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11472): The acpi\_ns\_terminate() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/nsutils.c in the Linux kernel before 4.12 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.


 - [CVE-2017-11473](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11473): Buffer overflow in the mp\_override\_legacy\_irq() function in arch/x86/kernel/acpi/boot.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.2 allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted ACPI table.


 - [CVE-2017-13693](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-13693): The acpi\_ds\_create\_operands() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/dsutils.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.


 - [CVE-2017-13694](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-13694): The acpi\_ps\_complete\_final\_op() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/psobject.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the node and node\_ext caches and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.


 - [CVE-2017-13695](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-13695): The acpi\_ns\_evaluate() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/nseval.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table. 


 - [CVE-2017-16837](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16837): Certain function pointers in Trusted Boot (tboot) through 1.9.6 are not validated and can cause arbitrary code execution, which allows local users to overwrite dynamic PCRs of Trusted Platform Module (TPM) by hooking these function pointers.


 - [CVE-2018-6622](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6622): An issue was discovered that affects all producers of BIOS firmware who make a certain realistic interpretation of an obscure portion of the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 specification. An abnormal case is not handled properly by this firmware while S3 sleep and can clear TPM 2.0. It allows local users to overwrite static PCRs of TPM and neutralize the security features of it, such as seal/unseal and remote attestation.


 - [CVE-2018-7995](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7995): ** DISPUTED ** Race condition in the store\_int\_with\_restart() function in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mcheck/mce.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by leveraging root access to write to the check\_interval file in a /sys/devices/system/machinecheck/machinecheck\<cpu number\> directory. NOTE: a third party has indicated that this report is not security relevant.
